# python-glicko2
A simple python implementation of Glicko-2 intended for use in a chess club.

A notebook for calculating changes in player's Glicko-2 rating. See: http://www.glicko.net/glicko/glicko2.pdf
Initial values are taken from a txt file of comma-separated values of the form: user,rating,RD,volatility
Game results are to be entered using the game() function in the appropiate cell.
I recommend restarting the kernel and reruning the whole notebook everytime this code is used, to avoid any unforseen complications.
